## Summary**
We’ve always been fascinated by the masterpieces we’ve seen in museums, but felt a certain disconnect because we rarely interacted with them outside seeing pictures online or viewing them in person.  We wanted to give users a way to enjoy fine art on their own terms.  Initially, we imagined the prospect of someone drawing a moustache on the Mona Lisa and decided we wanted to design an experience that allows users to interface with art in a fun, but respectful way, with the ultimate goal of creating an online community where users can save their creations to be viewed/rated and view/rate the creations of others.

## Description


## Application
This application was built utilizing MERN technologies. MERN is comprised of a collection of robust and powerful technologies used to develop scalable master web apps.  The collection of technologies primarily utilized are MongoDB, Express JS, React JS, and Node JS.

## MERN and Support Technologies
MongoDB is an open-source, cross platform and document-oriented database. It saves data, stores it in binary JSON format, permits fast exchanges of data between client and server and stores massive data that is highly scalable.
Express JS is a modular and lightweight framework which helps build robust and scalable web app by writing fast and securing applications.
React JS is an open-source JavaScript library used to build user interfaces, facilitates code reusability on multiple platforms and it is fast and scalable.
Node JS is an open-source and cross-platform, JS runtime environment that is designed to run the JavaScript code on the server-side.
