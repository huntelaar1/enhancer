## Summary**
We’ve always been fascinated by the masterpieces we’ve seen in museums, but felt a certain disconnect because we rarely interacted with them outside seeing pictures online or viewing them in person.  We wanted to give users a way to enjoy fine art on their own terms.  Initially, we imagined the prospect of someone drawing a moustache on the Mona Lisa or what would the painting of the iconic American Gothic would look like adhering to the covid-19 pandemic. We decided to design an experience that allows users to interface with art in a fun, but respectful way, with the ultimate goal of creating an online community where users can save their creations to be viewed/rated and view/rate the creations of others. This is an ambitious undertaken that presents a challenging opportunity for contributors or developer to pursue.

## Application
This application was built utilizing MERN technologies. MERN is comprised of a group of technologies primarily MongoDB, Express JS, React JS, and Node JS. Each of the technology tools contributed to the development of the application's front-end, back-end and supprt functionality to deliver a unique experience for the user.

The application is user friendly and easy to navigate. Users must Sign-Up on the home page to gain access to the application functionality. Once the user has successfully established a username and password, the application will present options to search selected images, the ability to create, recreate, and save their creations in a personal gallery.  

## MERN Technologies
### MongoDB is an open-source, cross platform and document-oriented database. It saves data, stores it in binary JSON format, permits fast exchanges of data between client and server and stores massive data that is highly scalable. (image below credited to Kanika Gupta, Classic Informatics):

### Express JS is a a modular and lightweight framework which helps build robust and scalable web app by writing fast and securing applications. This being used to build the back end for node js.

### React JS is an open-source JavaScript library used to build user interfaces, facilitates code reusability on multiple platforms and it is fast and scalable.

### Node JS is an open-source and cross-platform, JS runtime environment that is designed to run the JavaScript code on the server-side.

### API: MET Art API - Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET). Specifically, the Metropolitan Museum of Art Met Collection API is the Met’s Open Access datasets that are available through a RESTful web service in JSON format.
