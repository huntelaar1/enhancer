## Summary**
We’ve always been fascinated by the masterpieces we’ve seen in museums, but felt a certain disconnect because we rarely interacted with them outside seeing pictures online or viewing them in person.  We wanted to give users a way to enjoy fine art on their own terms.  Initially, we imagined the prospect of someone drawing a moustache on the Mona Lisa and decided we wanted to design an experience that allows users to interface with art in a fun, but respectful way, with the ultimate goal of creating an online community where users can save their creations to be viewed/rated and view/rate the creations of others.

## Application
This application was built utilizing MERN technologies. MERN is comprised of a group of technologies primarily MongoDB, Express JS, React JS, and Node JS. Each of the technology tools, contributed to the development of the application's front-end, back-end and supprt functionality to deliver a unique experience for the user.

The application is user friendly and easy to navigate. Users must Sign-Up on the home page to gain access to the application functionality. Once user has successfully established a username and password, the application will present options {TEAM: CONTINUE TO ADD CONTENT.... to search, the ability to create, recreate, save their creations in a personal gallery, consists for the following featuresto
