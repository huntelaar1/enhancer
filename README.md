## Summary**
We’ve always been fascinated by the masterpieces we’ve seen in museums, but felt a certain disconnect because we rarely interacted with them outside seeing pictures online or viewing them in person.  We wanted to give users a way to enjoy fine art on their own terms.  Initially, we imagined the prospect of someone drawing a moustache on the Mona Lisa and decided we wanted to design an experience that allows users to interface with art in a fun, but respectful way, with the ultimate goal of creating an online community where users can save their creations to be viewed/rated and view/rate the creations of others.
